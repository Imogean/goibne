## Gobine, the Legendary Blacksmith
This script is an attempt to automate Mabinogi's smithing mini-game.

*For it to work, set the game client's UI skin to "Electric Gray (Opaque)".*

### Usage:
 * Requires a relatively recent copy of [AutoHotKey](http://www.autohotkey.com/)
 * Compile `Goibne.ahk` to a standalone EXE, and run the resulting `Goibne.exe` as admin.
 * Open the blacksmithing window
 * Choose a finishing option
 * Add finishing materials to the window. The Start button should be lit up.
 * Click outside the Mabinogi window and press Ctrl-Alt-M
 * Wait. Smithing should proceed perfectly!...ish!
 
### Still to do...
 * I think I'd like to add the Tailoring minigame next.
 * Smithing doesn't seem to have perfect accuracy yet. It could be the client forces you to be a little off. Not sure.
